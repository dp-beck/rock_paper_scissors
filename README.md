# rock_paper_scissors
This is a simple implementation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors in javascript. In the game, there are two players -- one human and one computer. Each player chooses to play either rock, paper, or scissors at the same time (or, in this instance, unbeknownst to the other player). Rock beats scissors. Paper beats rock. Scissors beats paper. The game will end after five rounds.

Currently, it has no graphic user interface, but this feature will be added later.

The program will have user input in the form of the player selecting rock, paper, or scissors. The program will also need to randomly pick a selection for the computer player. The game will output (currently via console log) the results of each round. The game will output the final score after five rounds.

1. Randomly pick a play for computer.
2. Prompt user for a play.
3. Compare the two plays to determine winner of the round.
4. Store the score in a variable
5. State who won the round.
6. Repeat 1-5 five times.
7. After the fifth time, stop the loop and display the final score.
