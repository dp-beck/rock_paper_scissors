# rock_paper_scissors
This is a simple implementation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors in javascript. In the game, there are two players -- one human and one computer. Each player chooses to play either rock, paper, or scissors at the same time (or, in this instance, unbeknownst to the other player). Rock beats scissors. Paper beats rock. Scissors beats paper. The game ends when someone reaches 5.

The GUI has three buttons to record the player's choice and to play the round. Further, the GUI will show the score and announce who won.
